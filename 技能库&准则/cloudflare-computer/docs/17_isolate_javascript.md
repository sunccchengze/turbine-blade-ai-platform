# Isolate JavaScript runtime

`WorkerJavaScriptBackend` runs an ECMAScript module in a fresh Cloudflare Dynamic Worker:

```ts
import { Workspace } from "@cloudflare/computer";
import { WorkerJavaScriptBackend } from "@cloudflare/computer/backends/worker-javascript";

const workspace = new Workspace({
  storage: ctx.storage,
  backends: [
    new WorkerJavaScriptBackend({
      loader: env.LOADER,
      root: "/workspace",
      access: "read-write",
      defaultTimeoutMs: 60_000,
      maxTimeoutMs: 180_000,
      globalOutbound: null,
      modules: {
        "math-kit": `export const double = value => value * 2;`,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Execute a module through the common runtime entry point:

```ts
const handle = await workspace.runtime.exec(
  `
    import { double } from "math-kit";
    import fs from "node:fs/promises";

    export default async function main(input) {
      const value = double(input.value);
      await fs.writeFile("/workspace/result.txt", String(value));
      return { value, persisted: await fs.readFile("/workspace/result.txt", "utf8") };
    }
  `,
  {
    backend: "worker-javascript",
    input: { value: 21 },
    encoding: "utf8",
  },
);

const result = await handle.result();
// result.value = { value: 42, persisted: "42" }
```

The source is a real ES module. Static imports, literal dynamic imports, and top-level await are supported. If the module default-exports a function, Workspace invokes it with `options.input`. Otherwise module evaluation completes with a `null` structured result.

`runtime.exec()` returns before the Dynamic Worker finishes: the run keeps advancing while its event stream is consumed and the host call into the Dynamic Worker stays in flight. That pending work keeps the Durable Object resident on its own. A run whose handle is returned but never read can be evicted once the object goes idle; drain the event stream (or `result()`) to keep the run alive, and schedule an alarm through `ctx.storage.setAlarm()` for work that must survive eviction.

## Durable relative imports

Relative imports resolve from `cwd` through the durable Workspace filesystem:

```ts
await workspace.fs.writeFile(
  "/workspace/task.js",
  `
    import fs from "node:fs/promises";
    export default input => fs.writeFile("/workspace/value.txt", String(input.value));
  `,
);

await workspace.runtime.exec(
  `import task from "./task.js"; export default task;`,
  {
    backend: "worker-javascript",
    cwd: "/workspace",
    input: { value: 42 },
  },
);
```

Workspace parses the graph before loading the Worker, confines every durable path, rejects symlink traversal, and enforces aggregate source, module-count, and import-depth limits. Dynamic imports must use string literals.

## Execution limits and retention

The backend admits up to twenty-four executions at a time by default. A concurrent start past that ceiling fails with `EEXEC_BUSY` instead of creating an unbounded number of Dynamic Workers. Adjust `maxConcurrentExecutions` after measuring the Durable Object and Worker Loader limits for the deployment.

Each execution also bounds combined stdout and stderr output, active event subscribers, directory entries per read, concurrent and total capability calls, and cumulative capability request and response bytes. The corresponding `maxStdioBytes`, `maxExecutionSubscribers`, `maxDirectoryEntries`, and `max*Capability*` options may be lowered for public workloads. Directory reads apply their limit in SQLite before materializing rows. Requests are checked inside the isolate before Workers RPC and again by the host.

Completed execution records remain available for replay for sixty minutes by default. The backend also keeps at most 100 completed records. Configure these bounds with `retentionMs` and `maxRetainedExecutions`. Completed records leave the in-memory active set immediately; replay reads them from SQLite.

Cancellation stops new host capability calls, disposes the Dynamic Worker, and waits for host calls that were already accepted. Exit 130 is published only after those calls settle. Normal completion uses the same drain rule, so an unawaited capability call cannot mutate the workspace after exit 0.

Host calls have a caller-visible deadline, controlled by `maxHostCallMs` and defaulting to `maxTimeoutMs`. Missing the deadline fails the capability call and marks the execution failed, even if caller code catches that error. Execution still waits for the accepted host operation itself before publishing a terminal event because many host APIs cannot roll back an external side effect after dispatch. Trusted modules receive an optional `{ signal, deadline }` context and must stop promptly when the signal aborts. A trusted module that ignores cancellation and never settles will keep execution in its finalizing state. `compatibilityDate` and `compatibilityFlags` control the Dynamic Worker runtime and default to the package-tested settings.

## Environment, standard input, and the `process` shim

Each execution installs a small `node:process` shim so ordinary module code can read its environment and standard streams. The shim exposes only what the caller supplies for that execution; the host environment is never visible.

`process.env` is a snapshot of the `env` record passed on the exec options. Values the caller does not pass are absent, and the Durable Object's own environment is never merged in, so a module cannot read host bindings or secrets through `process.env`.

`process.stdin` is a non-interactive async-iterable over the caller-supplied `stdin` bytes. The caller passes `stdin` as a `Uint8Array` or string on the exec options; `for await` yields the bytes once and then ends, and there is no blocking read for further input because an evaluate-once execution has no session to wait on. `isTTY` is `false`. The supplied input is bounded by `maxStdinBytes`; exceeding it fails the run with a clear error.

`process.stdout` and `process.stderr` are writable streams whose writes flow to the live output described under Isolation and lifecycle. `console.log` and `console.info` route to standard output, `console.warn` and `console.error` route to standard error, and both share the single `maxStdioBytes` ceiling. `process.argv`, `process.cwd()`, and `process.platform` return inert values: `cwd()` reflects the execution's working directory, while `argv` and `platform` carry fixed placeholders rather than describing the host process.

```ts
const handle = await workspace.runtime.exec(
  `
    export default async function main() {
      let piped = "";
      for await (const chunk of process.stdin) piped += new TextDecoder().decode(chunk);
      console.log("received", piped.length, "bytes");
      return { who: process.env.WHO, piped };
    }
  `,
  {
    backend: "worker-javascript",
    env: { WHO: "demo" },
    stdin: "hello",
    encoding: "utf8",
  },
);
```

## Configured modules

Bare imports are installed at backend construction, not passed on individual executions:

```ts
new WorkerJavaScriptBackend({
  loader: env.LOADER,
  modules: {
    "tar-stream": TAR_STREAM_BUNDLE,
  },
});
```

Unknown bare imports fail before Worker creation. `node:fs` and `node:fs/promises` are host-installed exceptions backed by the durable Workspace. Configured modules are code, not host authority, and may not use the reserved `ws:` namespace or shadow either filesystem specifier.

## Trusted Workspace modules

Filesystem access uses the familiar asynchronous Node API, but is backed by the durable Workspace rather than an isolate-local filesystem. Both forms are installed automatically:

```js
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
// or: import { promises as fs } from "node:fs";

const text = await fs.readFile("/workspace/input.txt", "utf8");
await fs.writeFile("/workspace/output.txt", text.toUpperCase());
```

Supported promise APIs are `readFile`, `writeFile`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `chmod`, `symlink`, `readlink`, `readdir`, `stat`, `lstat`, and `access`. `readFile` returns bytes when encoding is omitted and supports `"utf8"` / `"utf-8"` for text; other encodings are rejected. `writeFile` supports the default `"w"` flag and exclusive `"wx"`; other Node flags are rejected, and—as in Node—the parent directory must already exist. Relative symlink targets are preserved by `readlink`, while reads and writes through symlinks are rejected by the Workspace confinement boundary. Synchronous and callback-style Node filesystem APIs are intentionally unavailable because every operation crosses the isolate-to-Workspace capability boundary.

The entire `ws:` namespace remains reserved for other Workspace-maintained host capabilities. The built-in runtime installs `ws:git` and `ws:artifacts`.

### `ws:git`

```js
import { clone, diff, status, log, cli } from "ws:git";
```

`ws:git` is explicit host authority rather than ambient isolate networking. Clone, fetch, pull, push, `ls-remote`, and submodule commands can perform host-side requests even when the Dynamic Worker has `globalOutbound: null`, so they are denied by default. Enable them only on a trusted backend construction with `allowGitNetwork: true`; local Git operations remain available without that authority. Remote `ws:artifacts.importArtifact()` is independently denied unless backend construction sets `allowArtifactNetwork: true`.

### `ws:artifacts`

```js
import {
  create,
  get,
  list,
  importArtifact,
  deleteArtifact,
} from "ws:artifacts";
```

These modules are sandbox-side shims over host RPC. Loader bindings, credentials, Durable Object storage, and unrestricted Workspace objects never enter user code. The host bridge checks the backend's fixed read/read-write authority on every mutation. Artifacts methods fail clearly when no Artifacts binding is configured.

Caller modules and durable files cannot shadow `node:fs`, `node:fs/promises`, or `ws:*`.

Path confinement rejects lexical escapes and every symlink component before an operation. These checks are not an atomic inode-style “resolve beneath root” primitive: do not treat one isolate capability as a security boundary against a separate, more privileged principal concurrently replacing paths in the same mutable Workspace. Deployments requiring that adversarial concurrency need a future transactional DOFS primitive or separate Workspace identities.

## Isolation and lifecycle

Each execution receives a fresh Dynamic Worker with:

- explicit Worker Loader CPU limits;
- a host wall-clock deadline;
- `globalOutbound: null` by default;
- finite, acyclic JSON-compatible input and structured result validation;
- configurable source/module graph, input, result, stdin, stdio, file/capability request, and response byte limits (`maxSourceBytes`, `maxInputBytes`, `maxResultBytes`, `maxStdinBytes`, `maxStdioBytes`, and `maxCapabilityBytes`);
- explicit entrypoint and Worker disposal;
- host-owned cancellation;
- retained events and result rows in the Workspace database.

Standard output and standard error stream live. The Dynamic Worker hands the readable end of its output stream to the host through the `attachOutput` bridge call, and the host drains it frame by frame while user code is still running, appending each chunk to the execution event stream as it arrives rather than buffering the run and publishing at the end. The structured result and the exit event settle once the output stream closes, so the terminal events always follow the last output. Output remains bounded by `maxStdioBytes` across both streams. Completed writes are durable immediately. Failure or cancellation does not roll back filesystem effects already completed.

## Trusted integrations

A host can configure additional reserved capability modules through `WorkerJavaScriptBackend.trustedModules`; these modules are fixed when the backend is constructed and cannot be supplied or replaced by caller source.
