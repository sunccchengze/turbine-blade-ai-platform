The feature is in beta for Enterprise customers.\n\n## Audience\n\nDevelopers who maintain API Workers, internal tooling, and report export endpoints.\n\n## Core behavior\n\n- Policies run at the start of a Worker request.\n- Safe methods such as \`GET\` and \`HEAD\` can be allowed without a bypass token.\n- Mutating methods such as \`POST\`, \`PUT\`, \`PATCH\`, and \`DELETE\` should require an explicit bypass token when the route handles sensitive exports.\n- Enterprise report exports may use a route-specific bypass token for scheduled jobs.\n- Denied requests should return a short reason string suitable for logs.\n\n## Docs requirements\n\n- Create \`docs/workers/smart-request-policies.md\`.\n- Add the new page to the Workers section in \`docs-nav.json\`.\n- Include a Worker example that checks method, pathname, and an \`x-bypass-token\` header.\n- Mention that beta policies do not replace application authorization.\n- Update the repository README so maintainers can find the new page.\n\n## Related topics\n\n- Routing rules are documented in \`docs/workers/routing.md\`.\n- Security recommendations are documented in \`docs/workers/security.md\`.\n`,
