// A backend produces a connection to a shell runtime. The
// Workspace constructor takes a set of backends keyed by `id`;
// `Workspace.runtime.exec("...", { backend })` picks one by id.
// `id` is user-supplied so the same shape can host multiple
// instances of the same backend kind (two workers on different
// loaders, a worker + a container side by side, ...). `type`
// is the kind itself: a small diagnostic string the backend
// hard-codes for tracing and stub-leak counters.
//
// Backends do not own the underlying runtime's lifecycle beyond
// the handle they hand back. close() on the BackendHandle tears
// down whatever the backend created on connect() (the SyncRPC
// stub, the container, etc.); a backend that doesn't own a
// container (TestBackend) only closes the stub.
//
// The interface stays narrow on purpose. Anything wire-specific
// (sync, exec, ...) sits on the returned rpc stub. Backends do
// not see method signatures; they only produce handles and tear
// them down.
