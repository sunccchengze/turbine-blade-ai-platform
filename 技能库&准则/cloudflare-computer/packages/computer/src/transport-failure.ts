// Conservative classifier for "the backend's transport is gone".
//
// The Workspace caches a BackendHandle per backend id and clears
// it when the handle's `closed` promise resolves. A wedged
// container or a half-broken capnweb session may surface failures
// through an RPC rejection long before that promise fires. To
// avoid handing the same broken stub to the next caller, the
// Workspace runs each backend-touching RPC through a try/catch
// that consults this classifier and invalidates the cached
// handle on a match.
//
// Two ways to flag a transport failure:
//
//   1. Throw a WorkspaceTransportError from backend code we own
//      (heartbeat onFailure, lease renewal, the container backend
//      itself). Direct, no string matching.
//
//   2. Pattern-match the error message for known phrases that
//      external libraries surface (capnweb session shutdown,
//      WebSocket close, container-port unreachable). Conservative
//      by design — false positives invalidate a still-good
//      handle, which costs a reconnect; false negatives keep a
//      dead stub around until the next signal.
//
// The classifier walks the cause chain so wrappers like
// "watermark sync failed: <inner>" still classify when the inner
// error is a transport failure.

// Tag class for transport failures we throw ourselves. Carrying
// a class identity lets the classifier match without string
// inspection, and lets callers wrap an underlying cause for
// observability without losing the classification.
