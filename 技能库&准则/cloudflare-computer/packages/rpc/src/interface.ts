// The wire contract for the workspace sync RPC. The DO side and the
// container-side computerd both implement this interface
// against a SQLite-backed VFS; the only thing that differs is which
// direction each method is called from.
//
// Naming summary:
//
//   push           — DO  → container.   Streams ChangeEntry.
//   pushObjects    — DO  → container.   Streams chunk bytes by hash.
//   fetchChanges   — DO  → container.   Streams ChangeEntry (request).
//   fetchObjects   — DO  → container.   Streams chunk bytes by hash (request).
//   hasObjects     — either probes the other. Returns the subset
//                    the receiver already holds.
//
// The exec / getExec / killExec / disposeExec surface hangs off a
// sibling ShellRPC interface. Both compose under the top-level
// WorkspaceRPC, so the wire stub exposes one stable surface while
// the two halves stay internally separable.

  // currentRev at the moment it captured the batch. The receiver
