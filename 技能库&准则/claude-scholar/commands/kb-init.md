# /kb-init

Use the new KB scaffold under `Research/{project-slug}/`.

## Run

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/obsidian-project-kb-core/scripts/project_kb.py" bootstrap \
  --cwd "$PWD" \
  --vault-path "$vault_path"
```

If `project` is provided, add:

```bash
--project-name "$project"
```

If `force=true`, add:

```bash
--force
```

## Verify

The scaffold must contain:

```text
Research/{project-slug}/
  00-Hub.md
  01-Plan.md
  02-Index.md
  Sources/*
  Knowledge/
  Experiments/
  Results/Reports/
  Writing/
  Daily/
  Maps/
  Archive/
  _system/
```

It must also keep repo-local `.claude/project-memory/*` as runtime binding metadata only.
