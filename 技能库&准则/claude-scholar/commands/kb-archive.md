# /kb-archive

Use this command for KB lifecycle actions.

## Project-level lifecycle

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/obsidian-project-kb-core/scripts/project_kb.py" lifecycle --cwd "$PWD" --mode "$action"
```

Project archive means moving the whole project to:

```text
Research/_archived/{project-slug}-{date}/
```

## Note-level lifecycle

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/obsidian-project-kb-core/scripts/project_kb.py" note-lifecycle --cwd "$PWD" --mode "$action" --note "$target"
```

If `action=rename`, also pass `--dest "$dest"`.

Note archive means moving a canonical note into:

```text
Research/{project-slug}/Archive/
```
